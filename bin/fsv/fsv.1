.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a process supervisor.
It is able to:
.Bl -bullet -width 1n -offset Ds
.It
Run a command
.Va cmd ,
restarting it if it exits for any reason.
.It
Optionally run another
.Va log
process to reliably log messages,
even if either process is restarted.
.It
Maintain state information for the
.Va fsv
process itself as well as
.Va cmd
and
.Va log .
.El
.\"
.\"
.Pp
.Nm
is designed to run daemons
\(em long-running non-interactive processes \(em
which may occasionally crash for various reasons.
Typically, one wants the daemon to simply restart and go back about its
business,
but this can cause an infinite loop in the case of an enduring error.
Repeated crashes could also indicate a malicious actor trying to attack the
daemon, especially in the case of a network service.
.Pp
Thus,
.Nm
keeps track of how many times it has restarted each command recently
and allows you to decide what it should do
if it reaches too high of a value.
.\"
.\" recent_execs
.\"
.Pp
This value is called
.Va recent_execs ,
and
.Nm
keeps track of it for both the
.Va cmd
and
.Va log
processes.
.Va recent_execs
starts at 0 and will increment every time the process is executed, unless
.Va recent_secs
or more seconds have passed.
In this case, the event is considered the start of a new string of crashes and
.Va recent_execs
is set back to 1.
.Va recent_secs
can instead be set to 0 if you never want
.Va recent_execs
to reset.
.Pp
The maximum number of allowed
.Va recent_execs
can be set with
.Va recent_execs_max .
In the event that this number is about to be exceeded by
.Va cmd ,
.Nm
will take action according to
.Va timeout .
If
.Va timeout
is non-zero,
.Nm
will wait
.Va timeout
seconds before restarting the process again.
If
.Va timeout
is zero,
.Nm
will
.Dq give up
and exit.
.Pp
.Va timeout
is always zero for the
.Va log
process.
This is because it is a very
.Em bad
thing if the log process starts crashing \(em
the pipe will fill up and
.Xr write 2
calls will start blocking or failing when the
.Va cmd
process tries to log.
.Pp
You can view the status information with
.Fl p ,
.Fl S ,
or
.Fl s .
When these flags are used,
.Nm
will exit 0 if an
.Nm
instance is running that
.Ar name ,
and 1 otherwise.
.\"
.\" options
.\"
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl B
Daemonize by calling
.Xr daemon 3 ,
but don't modify
.Dv stdin ,
.Dv stdout ,
and
.Dv stderr .
.It Fl b , Fl -background , Fl -daemon
Daemonize by calling
.Xr daemon 3
to detach from the session.
.Dv stdin ,
.Dv stdout ,
and
.Dv stderr
are set to
.Pa /dev/null .
This implies
.Fl Y .
.It Fl d , Fl -debug
Log messages up to and including
.Dv LOG_DEBUG .
Equivalent to
.Fl L Ar debug .
.It Fl h , Fl -help
Print a brief help message.
.It Fl L , Fl -loglevel Ar level
Log up to the specified
.Ar level ;
see
.Xr syslog 3 .
.It Fl l , Fl -log Ar log
Program to pipe the output of
.Va cmd
into.
Double-quotes are supported to allow spaces in arguments.
.It Fl M , Fl -max-execs-log Ar max
Set
.Va max_recent_execs
for the
.Va log
process.
.It Fl m , Fl -max-execs Ar max
Set
.Va max_recent_execs
for the
.Va cmd
process.
.It Fl n , Fl -name Ar name
Use
.Ar name
instead of letting
.Nm
choose it automatically.
.It Fl o , Fl -output-mask Ar mask
Used to specify what output to redirect from
.Va cmd
to
.Va log :
.Dv stdout Pq 1 ,
.Dv stderr Pq 2 ,
or
.Dv both Pq 3 .
Default is 3.
.It Fl p , Fl -pids Ar name
Print the PIDs of the
.Va fsv ,
.Va cmd ,
and
.Va log
processes for the indicated
.Ar name .
.It Fl R , Fl -recent-secs-log Ar secs
Set
.Va recent_recs
for
.Va log .
.It Fl r , Fl -recent-secs Ar secs
Set
.Va recent_secs
for
.Va cmd .
.It Fl S , Fl -status-exit Ar name
Exit 0 if that
.Ar name
is running,
1 if not.
.It Fl s , Fl -status Ar name
Print status information for
.Ar name .
.It Fl t , Fl -timeout Ar secs
Set
.Va timeout
for
.Va cmd .
.It Fl V , Fl -version
Print version and exit.
.It Fl Y , Fl -syslog-only
Log only to
.Xr syslog 3 .
.It Fl y , Fl -syslog
Log to
.Xr syslog 3
syslog as well as
.Dv stderr .
.El
.\"
.\"
.Sh FILES
.Nm
keeps its state information in a file tree rooted at
.Dv FSV_CMDDIR_PREFIX ,
by default
.Pa /tmp .
This is configurable as a compile-time preprocessor constant
and should be a
.Dq sticky
directory
.Po
If you don't know what this means, see
.Xr chmod 1
.Pc .
.Pp
Under
.Dv FSV_CMDDIR_PREFIX
is a unique
.Va fsvdir
for each user.
Their names are of the format
.Pa fsv-UID ,
where
.Ql UID
is an integer as returned by
.Xr geteuid 2 .
.Pp
Within each
.Va fsvdir
lie the
.Va cmddir
directories which are named after the
.Va cmdname
of each process.
Typically, the
.Va cmdname
is figured out automatically by
.Nm
from the executable name,
but you can override it with
.Fl n .
For example, you may want to use a
.Va cmdname
of
.Ql dbus
for
.Ql dbus-daemon .
.\"
.\"
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
exits non-zero on error.
This is typically 64
.Pq In sysexits.h EX_USAGE
for usage error, and 1 otherwise.
Exiting due to
.Va timeout
being zero is considered successful.
.Nm
tries to do everything that could generate an error before
it starts
.Va cmd
and
.Va log ,
and before calling
.Xr daemon 3
if
.Fl b
was specified.
In this case, it prints the error directly to
.Dv stderr
and exits non-zero.
.\"
.\"
.Sh EXAMPLES
Run
.Xr ls 1
as the
.Va cmd
with debugging output.
.Dl $ fsv -d ls -al
.Pp
Add
.Xr tee 1
as the logging process.
.Dl $ fsv -d -l 'tee -a /dev/tty' ls -al
.Pp
Get the status.
.Va gaveup
should be true since the
.Xr ls 1
seems to be a very unstable daemon that is crashing immediately every time.
.Dl $ fsv -s ls
.\"
.\"
.Sh CAVEATS
.Nm
will
.Xr chdir 2
to a specific directory before executing
.Va cmd
and
.Va log ,
so using relative paths to a program
.Pq Pa ./foo , Pa foo/bar
will not work as expected.
Use an absolute path
.Pq Pa /usr/local/bin/foo
instead.
.\"
.\"
.Sh BUGS
.Va recent_execs
will always display as at least 1 in the
.Fl s , Fl -status
output.
This is because
.Nm
only wakes up to recalculate and update this value when the process restarts;
thus, it will never be zero.
This may be fixed in a future version of
.Nm .
